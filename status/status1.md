## Recap of what was planned for the last 3 weeks [5pt]

Addie: For the first three weeks, my plan was to get set up using AWS for our site and get a base site hosted.  
Austin: My plan was to do whatever became necessary for setting up the first version of a computer division model.  
Dylan: The plan was to create a base Angular project and complete a base version of the main web pages.

## Tasks Completed What was done during the last 3 weeks (by whom) [5 pt]

Austin: Aggregate the training data, watched a lot of lectures to get my bearings on computer vision, and set up the python environment. The quantifiable metric is the git commits to the repo.  
Addie: Set up an AWS account and got our base website hosted on it (https://main.d2pr9vfn2vnfra.amplifyapp.com/). Additionally researched AWS’ cost structure in order to evaluate the long-term cost of hosting our site as well as attempting to set up the measures to ensure we don’t get charged.  
Dylan: The base Angular project was created and pushed to the group repo. After this, the home page, about us page, and mountain gallery page were created locally and awaiting final touches to be pushed to the group repo.  
We all also met with Ward.  

## Successes [5pt]

We accomplished the basics of getting the github and model environment set up and have a hosted base Angular website. We tried a couple of different software packages for downloading images in bulk from Google, and a Chrome extension actually ended up working the best. 

## Roadblocks/Challenges [5pts]

One main challenge this week was the aggregation of training data in bulk without a bunch of manual labor. This got resolved without too much trouble via some mature software packages for this purpose.  
Specifically with setting up a site on AWS, this did prove to be a bit of a challenge, as we’ve never done this from scratch before. It was frustrating at first when Addie was just walking through AWS’ screens and prompts on her own, but ended up running into some issue or another each time and having to delete the site and try again. To overcome this, she ended up looking up a full tutorial for how to do this with the tech stack we were using and ended up being much more successful this way (and certainly should have just started with a tutorial in the first place).  
I don’t think we currently need any help with anything specific, but in general we just will appreciate meeting with our mentor over the course of the semester and being there for check-ins if we need.

## Changes/Deviation from Plan ​(if applicable - if not, say so!) [0 pts]

No major deviations from the plan.

## Details Description of Goals/ Plan for ​Next 3 Weeks [5pts]

Austin: In the next three weeks, I would like to have a fully trained model and the code for the website to interact with it.  
Addie: In the next three weeks, I would like to have a general website design aesthetic set up and base CSS and bootstrap implemented.  
Dylan: Throughout the next three weeks, continued functionality to support the backend processes will be implemented via forms. Continued work will be made on the pages and their style. I plan to also start looking into creating supportive material such as a tutorial video on how to use our application, as well as looking into creating graphics for the site’s look and feel.

## Confidence on completion from each team member + team average [5 pts]
Scale of 1-5; 1 = not-confident; 3 = toss-up; 5 = confident  
Austin: 5  
Addie: 5  
Dylan: 5  
Team average: 5
