## Recap of what was planned for the last 3 weeks [5pt]

Addie: My plan for the last three weeks was to finalize the “About Us” page of our website and get our website’s layout to be mobile-phone-friendly.

Austin: My plan for the last 3 weeks was to continue improving the model.

Dylan: I was responsible for implementing the data collection and formatting of the user data for the model.

## Tasks Completed What was done during the last 3 weeks (by whom) [5 pt]

Austin:  I changed the output layer to produce predicted class probability. 

Addie: Over the course of the last 3 weeks, I essentially finalized our “About Us” page (styling and content polishing). I additionally implemented a dynamic layout for this page that switches the row layout of the page into a column on small screen sizes.

Dylan: Finished the data formatting that we collected from the user. Austin and I also independently met to have the front-end web application use the model to run predictions on imputed user images.

We all also met with Ward.  

## Successes [5pt]
The website is starting to look polished and more professional than just having base text and functionality implemented (essentially bringing us to our website minimum viable product and to the point where we can start adding on).

## Roadblocks/Challenges [5pts]
We are currently having a dependency issue with installing the necessary libraries needed to generate our needed “model.json” file. However, this is a known issue with the Mac OS and we have made plans to ensure that at least one of us are capable of generating the JSON file through the use of Windows OS.

## Changes/Deviation from Plan ​(if applicable - if not, say so!) [0 pts]

No major deviations from the plan.

## Details Description of Goals/ Plan for ​Next 3 Weeks [5pts]

Austin: My next target is to finish integrating the model into the website with Dylan. After that, I will expand the model to classify more mountains. 

Addie: Over the course of the next three weeks, I plan to help the team get our classification model all hooked up with our user interface. Additionally, I plan to implement a sort of “Gallery” page for the mountains that our model is trained to classify to let users know which mountains they can expect our model to work with as well as some facts about those mountains (and to beef up our webpage a little).

Dylan: Resolve the dependency issue that is coming from the TensorFlow library. I will also complete the user forms look and feel. Once those have been completed, I will utilize a modal to show the user our model's prediction. Any additional calculations to/from the model will be handled by me.

## Confidence on completion from each team member + team average [5 pts]
Scale of 1-5; 1 = not-confident; 3 = toss-up; 5 = confident  
Austin: 5  
Addie: 5  
Dylan: 5  
Team average: 5
